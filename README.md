# System Documentation

This repository contains [C4 model files](https://c4model.com/) (.c4) that define software architecture diagrams for various systems. The C4 model is a simple yet powerful approach for visualizing and documenting software architecture, focusing on the context, containers, components, and code of a system.

In this repository, you'll find C4 model definitions for the Makerspace software systems, including the various software systems, applications, databases, and actors involved.

The files here are using the likec4.dev implementation of the C4 model language. You can find the source code for the implementation [here](https://github.com/LikeC4/likec4).
